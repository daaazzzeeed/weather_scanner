# Weather scanner

You are provided with a set of CSV files containing weather information from different stations in the US for a period in 2014-2015.

The 4-letter file name corresponds to the short name (abbreviation) of a weather station. Definitions of abbreviations is given in a separate file - stations.csv

Implemented the following repetitive request-response workflow: the user enters a date and a location name, the program prints the main information about the weather in a given location on a given date (only the actual mean temperature and actual precipitation) The user may enter only part of the readable location name, e.g. Jacksonville, the program should still recognize it and pick the appropriate location, i.e. KJAX
